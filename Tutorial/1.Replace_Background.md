# Extract background image

**Before you start you'd better backup the gfs files you need.**

Find `levels-textures2d.gfs` in left panel, usually it's located in `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Skullgirls/data01`.  Then right click it and select **Unpack GFS**.

All the images are saved in `.dds` files. 

# Convert .dds and Pack

Since `.dds` files are not editable in `Photoshop` directly, I create a `3750*2000` pixel brand new canvas in Photoshop and fill it with white background, then I save it as `bg.png`. Then go https://convertio.co/ to convert files to `.dds` format:

 replace the origin files(e.g. ` stage_class_notes.dds` and ` stage_class_notes-alt.dds`) in the extract folder:

Then go to SkullModPy2 and locate the extracted `.gfs` folder and right click it, select **Pack directory**:

A new `.gfs` file is generated. Then replace the origin one. My pure white background `.dds` file can be found in `./Resouce` folder if you don't want to edit it, but **REMEMBER BACKUP THE ORIGIN GFS FILE!**

# Game config

Launch the game and go to **Help A& Options**, select Video Settings and change Stage Background to 2D:
